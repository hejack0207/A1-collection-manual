### report

The command **blkzone report** is used to report device zone information.

By default, the command will report all zones from the start of the
block device. Options may be used to modify this behavior, changing the
starting zone or the size of the report, as explained below.

### reset

The command **blkzone reset** is used to reset one or more zones. Unlike
**sg_reset_wp**(8),
this command operates from the block layer and can reset a range of zones.

By default, the command will operate from the zone at device 
sector 0 and reset all zones. Options may be used to modify this behavior
as well as specify the operation to be performed on the zone, as explained below.

# Options

The
_offset_
and
_length_
option arguments may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024),
MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is
optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes
KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.
Additionally, the 0x prefix can be used to specify _offset_ and
_length_ in hex.

* **-o**,** --offset **_sector_  
  The starting zone specified as a sector offset. The provided offset in sector
  units (512 bytes) should match the start of a zone. The default value is zero.
* **-l**,** --length **_sectors_  
  The maximum number of sectors the command should operate on. The default value
  is the number of sectors remaining after _offset_. This option cannot be
  used together with the option **--count**.
* **-c**,** --count **_count_  
  The maximum number of zones the command should operate on. The default value
  is the number of zones starting from _offset_. This option cannot be
  used together with the option **--length**.
* **-v**,** --verbose**  
  Display the number of zones returned in the report or the range of sectors
  reset..
* **-V**,** --version**  
  Display version information and exit.
* **-h**,** --help**
