# ltrace.conf(5)

"", October 2012


**ltrace.conf** - Configuration file for **ltrace(1)**.


<a name="description"></a>

# Description


This manual page describes **ltrace.conf**, a file that describes
prototypes of functions in binaries for **ltrace(1)** to use.
Ltrace needs this information to display function call arguments.

Each line of a configuration file describes at most a single item.
Lines composed entirely of white space are ignored, as are lines
starting with semicolon character (comment lines).  Described items
can be either function prototypes, or definitions of type aliases.


<a name="prototypes"></a>

# Prototypes


A prototype describes return type and parameter types of a single
function.  The syntax is as follows:

_LENS_ _NAME_ **(**[_LENS_{,_LENS_}]**);**

_NAME_ is the (mangled) name of a symbol.  In the elementary case,
_LENS_ is simply a type.  Both lenses and types are described
below.  For example, a simple function prototype might look like this:

**int kill(int,int);**

Despite the apparent similarity with C, **ltrace.conf** is really
its own language that's only somewhat inspired by C.


<a name="types"></a>

# Types


Ltrace understands a range of primitive types.  Those are interpreted
according to C convention native on a given architecture.
E.g. **ulong** is interpreted as 4-byte unsigned integer on 32-bit
GNU/Linux machine, but 8-byte unsigned integer on 64-bit GNU/Linux
machine.


* **void**  
  Denotes that a function does not return anything.  Can be also used to
  construct a generic pointer, i.e. pointer-sized number formatted in
  hexadecimal format.
* **char**  
  8-bit quantity rendered as a character
* **ushort,short**  
  Denotes unsigned or signed short integer.
* **uint,int**  
  Denotes unsigned or signed integer.
* **ulong,long**  
  Denotes unsigned or signed long integer.
* **float**  
  Denotes floating point number with single precision.
* **double**  
  Denotes floating point number with double precision.


Besides primitive types, the following composed types are possible:


* **struct([_LENS_{,_LENS_}]**)****  
  Describes a structure with given types as fields,
  e.g. **struct(int,int,float)**.
  
  Alignment is computed as customary on the architecture.  Custom
  alignment (e.g. packed structs) and bit-fields are not supported.
  It's also not possible to differentiate between structs and non-POD
  C++ classes, for arches where it makes a difference.
  
* **array(_LENS_**,EXPR**)**  
  Describes array of length _EXPR_, which is composed of types
  described by _LENS_, e.g. **array(int, **6**)**.
  
  Note that in C, arrays in role of function argument decay into
  pointers.  Ltrace currently handles this automatically, but for full
  formal correctness, any such arguments should be described as pointers
  to arrays.
  
* _LENS*_  
  Describes a pointer to a given type, e.g. **char*** or **int*****.
  Note that the former example actually describes a pointer to a
  character, not a string.  See below for **string** lens, which is
  applicable to these cases.

# Lenses


Lenses change the way that types are described.  In the simplest case,
a lens is directly a type.  Otherwise a type is decorated by the lens.
Ltrace understands the following lenses:


* **oct(TYPE)**  
  The argument, which should be an integer type, is formatted in base-8.
  
* **hex(TYPE)**  
  The argument, which should be an integer or floating point type, is
  formatted in base-16.  Floating point arguments are converted to
  double and then displayed using the **%a** fprintf modifier.
  
* **hide(TYPE)**  
  The argument is not shown in argument list.
  
* **bool(TYPE)**  
  Arguments with zero value are shown as "false", others are shown as
  "true".
  
* **bitvec(TYPE)**  
  Underlying argument is interpreted as a bit vector and a summary of
  bits set in the vector is displayed.  For example if bits 3,4,5 and 7
  of the bit vector are set, ltrace shows &lt;3-5,7&gt;.  Empty bit vector is
  displayed as &lt;&gt;.  If there are more bits set than unset, inverse is
  shown instead: e.g. ~&lt;0&gt; when a number 0xfffffffe is displayed.  Full
  set is thus displayed ~&lt;&gt;.
  
  If the underlying type is integral, then bits are shown in their
  natural big-endian order, with LSB being bit 0.
  E.g. **bitvec(ushort)** with value 0x0102 would be displayed as
  &lt;1,8&gt;, irrespective of underlying byte order.
  
  For other data types (notably structures and arrays), the underlying
  data is interpreted byte after byte.  Bit 0 of first byte has number
  0, bit 0 of second byte number 8, and so on.  Thus
  **bitvec(struct(int))** is endian sensitive, and will show bytes
  comprising the integer in their memory order.  Pointers are first
  dereferenced, thus **bitvec(array(char, **32**)*)** is actually a
  pointer to 256-bit bit vector.
  

**string(TYPE)**  
**string[EXPR]**  
**string**
The first form of the argument is canonical, the latter two are
syntactic sugar.  In the canonical form, the function argument is
formatted as string.  The _TYPE_ shall be either a **char***, or
**array(char,EXPR)**, or **array(char,EXPR)***.  If an
array is given, the length will typically be a **zero** expression
(but doesn't have to be).  Using argument that is plain array
(i.e. not a pointer to array) makes sense e.g. in C structs, in cases
like **struct(string(array(char, **6**)))**, which describes the C
type **struct {char **s**[**6**];}**.

Because simple C-like strings are pretty common, there are two
shorthand forms.  The first shorthand form (with brackets) means the
same as **string(array(char, EXPR)*)**.  Plain **string**
without an argument is then taken to mean the same as
**string[zero]**.

Note that **char*** by itself describes a pointer to a char.  Ltrace
will dereference the pointer, and read and display the single
character that it points to.

**enum(_NAME_[**=_VALUE**]{,NAME_[**=VALUE**]})**  
**enum[_TYPE**](NAME**[**=VALUE**]{,NAME_[**=VALUE**]})**
This describes an enumeration lens.  If an argument has any of the
given values, it is instead shown as the corresponding _NAME_.  If
a _VALUE_ is omitted, the next consecutive value following after
the previous _VALUE_ is taken instead.  If the first _VALUE_
is omitted, it's **0** by default.

_TYPE_, if given, is the underlying type.  It is thus possible to
create enums over shorts or longs—arguments that are themselves
plain, non-enum types in C, but whose values can be meaningfully
described as enumerations.  If omitted, _TYPE_ is taken to be
**int**.


<a name="type-aliases"></a>

# Type Aliases


A line in config file can, instead of describing a prototype, create a
type alias.  Instead of writing the same enum or struct on many places
(and possibly updating when it changes), one can introduce a name for
such type, and later just use that name:

**typedef NAME = LENS;**


<a name="recursive-structures"></a>

# Recursive Structures


Ltrace allows you to express recursive structures.  Such structures
are expanded to the depth described by the parameter -A.  To declare a
recursive type, you first have to introduce the type to ltrace by
using forward declaration.  Then you can use the type in other type
definitions in the usual way:

**typedef NAME = struct;**  
**typedef NAME** = struct(NAME** can be used here)**

For example, consider the following singy-linked structure and a
function that takes such list as an argument:

**typedef int_list = struct;**  
**typedef int_list **= struct(int,** int_list*);**  
**void ll**(**int_list*);**

Such declarations might lead to an output like the following:

ll({ 9, { 8, { 7, { 6, ... } } } }) = &lt;void&gt;

Ltrace detects recursion and will not expand already-expanded
structures.  Thus a doubly-linked list would look like the following:

**typedef int_list = struct;**  
**typedef int_list **= struct(int,** int\_list***,** int_list*);**

With output e.g. like:

ll({ 9, { 8, { 7, { 6, ..., ... }, recurse^ }, recurse^ }, nil })

The "recurse^" tokens mean that given pointer points to a structure
that was expanded in the previous layer.  Simple "recurse" would mean
that it points back to this object.  E.g. "recurse^^^" means it points
to a structure three layers up.  For doubly-linked list, the pointer
to the previous element is of course the one that has been just
expanded in the previous round, and therefore all of them are either
recurse^, or nil.  If the next and previous pointers are swapped, the
output adjusts correspondingly:

ll({ 9, nil, { 8, recurse^, { 7, recurse^, { 6, ..., ... } } } })



<a name="expressions"></a>

# Expressions


Ltrace has support for some elementary expressions.  Each expression
can be either of the following:


* _NUM_  
  An integer number.
  
* **argNUM**  
  Value of _NUM_-th argument.  The expression has the same value as
  the corresponding argument.  **arg1** refers to the first argument,
  **arg0** to the return value of the given function.
  
* **retval**  
  Return value of function, same as **arg0**.
  
* **eltNUM**  
  Value of _NUM_-th element of the surrounding structure type.  E.g.
  **struct(ulong,array(int,elt1))** describes a structure whose first
  element is a length, and second element an array of ints of that
  length.
  

**zero**  
**zero(EXPR)**
Describes array which extends until the first element, whose each byte
is 0.  If an expression is given, that is the maximum length of the
array.  If NUL terminator is not found earlier, that's where the array
ends.


<a name="parameter-packs"></a>

# Parameter Packs


Sometimes the actual function prototype varies slightly depending on
the exact parameters given.  For example, the number and types of
printf parameters are not known in advance, but ltrace might be able
to determine them in runtime.  This feature has wider applicability,
but currently the only parameter pack that ltrace supports is
printf-style format string itself:


* **format**  
  When **format** is seen in the parameter list, the underlying string
  argument is parsed, and GNU-style format specifiers are used to
  determine what the following actual arguments are.  E.g. if the format
  string is "%s %d\\n", it's as if the **format** was replaced by
  **string, string, int**.
  

<a name="return-arguments"></a>

# Return Arguments


C functions often use one or more arguments for returning values back
to the caller.  The caller provides a pointer to storage, which the
called function initializes.  Ltrace has some support for this idiom.

When a traced binary hits a function call, ltrace first fetches all
arguments.  It then displays _left_ portion of the argument list.
Only when the function returns does ltrace display _right_ portion
as well.  Typically, left portion takes up all the arguments, and
right portion only contains return value.  But ltrace allows you to
configure where exactly to put the dividing line by means of a **+**
operator placed in front of an argument:

**int asprintf(+string*, format);**

Here, the first argument to asprintf is denoted as return argument,
which means that displaying the whole argument list is delayed until
the function returns:

a.out-&gt;asprintf( &lt;unfinished ...&gt;  
libc.so.6-&gt;malloc(100)                   = 0x245b010  
[... more calls here ...]  
&lt;... asprintf resumed&gt; "X=1", "X=%d", 1) = 5

It is currently not possible to have an "inout" argument that passes
information in both directions.
