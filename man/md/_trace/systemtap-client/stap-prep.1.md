# stap\-prep(1) - prepare system for systemtap use



<a name="synopsis"></a>

# Synopsis


```

stap-prep [ KERNEL_VERSION ]
```


<a name="description"></a>

# Description


The stap-prep executable prepares the system for systemtap use by
installing kernel headers, debug symbols and build tools that match
the currently running kernel or optionally the kernel version given by
the user.

If the debuginfod-find tool is installed and is able to fetch
debuginfo for a kernel component, it is assumed to remain available
later.  In this case, no debug symbols will be downloaded during
stap-prep.

The exact behavior of stap-prep may be customized by the
distribution maintainers. It might for example only give suggestions
and not actually install the required packages if that is difficult to
automate.
