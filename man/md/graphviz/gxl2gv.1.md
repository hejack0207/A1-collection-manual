# Description

**gxl2gv**
converts between graphs represented in GXL and in the
GV language. Unless a conversion type is specified using
a flag,
**gxl2gv**
will deduce the type of conversion from the suffix of
the input file, a ".gv" suffix causing a conversion from GV
to GXL, and a ".gxl" suffix causing a conversion from GXL to GV.
If no suffix is available, e.g. when the input is from a pipe,
and no flags are used then
**gxl2gv**
assumes the type of the input file from its executable name
so that
**gxl2gv**
converts from GXL to GV, and
**gv2gxl**
converts from GV to GXL.

GXL supports a much richer graph model than GV. **gxl2gv**
will attempt to map GXL constructs into the analogous GV construct
when this is possible. If not, the GXL information is stored as
an attribute. The intention is that applying **gxl2gv|gv2gxl**
is semantically equivalent to the identity operator.

# Options

The following options are supported:

* **-g**  
  The command name and input file extensions are ignored, the
  input is taken as a GV file and a GXL file is generated.
* **-d**  
  The command name and input file extensions are ignored, the
  input is taken as a GXL file and a GV file is generated.
* **-?**  
  Prints usage information and exits.
* **-o**_ outfile_  
  If specified, the output will be written into the file
  _outfile_. Otherwise, output is written to standard out.

# Operands

The following operand is supported:

* _files_  
  Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in GXL or GV.
  If no
  _files_
  operand is specified,
  the standard input will be used.

# Return Codes

Both **gxl2gv** and **gv2gxl** return **0**
if there were no problems during conversion;
and non-zero if any error occurred.

<a name="bugs"></a>

# Bugs

**gxl2gv** will only convert in one direction even if given multiple files
with varying suffixes.

The conversion can only handle one graph per GXL file.

There are some GXL constructs which **gxl2gv** cannot handle.
