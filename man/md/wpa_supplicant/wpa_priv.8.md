# Overview


**wpa\_priv** is a privilege separation helper that
minimizes the size of **wpa\_supplicant** code that needs
to be run with root privileges.

If enabled, privileged operations are done in the wpa_priv process
while leaving rest of the code (e.g., EAP authentication and WPA
handshakes) to operate in an unprivileged process (wpa_supplicant) that
can be run as non-root user. Privilege separation restricts the effects
of potential software errors by containing the majority of the code in an
unprivileged process to avoid the possibility of a full system
compromise.

**wpa\_priv** needs to be run with network admin
privileges (usually, root user). It opens a UNIX domain socket for each
interface that is included on the command line; any other interface will
be off limits for **wpa\_supplicant** in this kind of
configuration. After this, **wpa\_supplicant** can be run as
a non-root user (e.g., all standard users on a laptop or as a special
non-privileged user account created just for this purpose to limit access
to user files even further).

# Example Configuration


The following steps are an example of how to configure
**wpa\_priv** to allow users in the
**wpapriv** group to communicate with
**wpa\_supplicant** with privilege separation:

Create user group (e.g., wpapriv) and assign users that
should be able to use wpa_supplicant into that group.

Create /var/run/wpa_priv directory for UNIX domain sockets and
control user access by setting it accessible only for the wpapriv
group:


    mkdir /var/run/wpa_priv
    chown root:wpapriv /var/run/wpa_priv
    chmod 0750 /var/run/wpa_priv
    


Start **wpa\_priv** as root (e.g., from system
startup scripts) with the enabled interfaces configured on the
command line:


    wpa_priv -B -c /var/run/wpa_priv -P /var/run/wpa_priv.pid wext:wlan0
    


Run **wpa\_supplicant** as non-root with a user
that is in the wpapriv group:


    wpa_supplicant -i ath0 -c wpa_supplicant.conf

# Command Arguments


* **-c ctrl path**  
  Specify the path to wpa_priv control directory
  (Default: /var/run/wpa_priv/).
* **-B**  
  Run as a daemon in the background.
* **-P file**  
  Set the location of the PID
  file.
* **driver:ifname [driver:ifname ...]**  
  The &lt;driver&gt; string dictates which of the
  supported **wpa\_supplicant** driver backends is to be
  used. To get a list of supported driver types see wpa_supplicant help
  (e.g, wpa_supplicant -h). The driver backend supported by most good
  drivers is **wext**.
  
  The &lt;ifname&gt; string specifies which network
  interface is to be managed by **wpa\_supplicant**
  (e.g., wlan0 or ath0).
  
  **wpa\_priv** does not use the network interface
  before **wpa\_supplicant** is started, so it is fine to
  include network interfaces that are not available at the time wpa_priv
  is started. wpa_priv can control multiple interfaces with one process,
  but it is also possible to run multiple **wpa\_priv**
  processes at the same time, if desired.
