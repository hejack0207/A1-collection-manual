# auditd.conf:(5) - audit daemon configuration file

Red Hat, August 2018


<a name="description"></a>

# Description

The file
_/etc/audit/auditd.conf_
contains configuration information specific to the audit daemon. Each line should contain one configuration keyword, an equal sign, and then followed by appropriate configuration information. All option names and values are case insensitive. The keywords recognized are listed and described below. Each line should be limited to 160 characters or the line will be skipped. You may add comments to the file by starting the line with a '#' character.


* _local_events_  
  This yes/no keyword specifies whether or not to include local events. Normally
  you want local events so the default value is yes. Cases where you would set
  this to no is when you want to aggregate events only from the network. At the
  moment, this is useful if the audit daemon is running in a container. This
  option can only be set once at daemon start up. Reloading the config file
  has no effect.
* _log_file_  
  This keyword specifies the full path name to the log file where audit records
  will be stored. It must be a regular file.
* _write_logs_  
  This yes/no keyword determines whether or not to write logs to the disk.
  Normally you want this so the default is yes.
* _log_format_  
  The log format describes how the information should be stored on disk. There are 2 options: raw and enriched. If set to
  _RAW_,
  the audit records will be stored in a format exactly as the kernel sends it. The
  _ENRICHED_
  option will resolve all uid, gid, syscall, architecture, and socket address information before writing the event to disk. This aids in making sense of events created on one system but reported/analyzed on another system.
  The 
  _NOLOG_
  option is now deprecated. If you were setting this format, now you should set
  the write_logs option to no.
* _log_group_  
  This keyword specifies the group that is applied to the log file's permissions. The default is root. The group name can be either numeric or spelled out.
* _priority_boost_  
  This is a non-negative number that tells the audit daemon how much of a priority boost it should take. The default is 4. No change is 0.
* _flush_  
  Valid values are
  _none_, _incremental_, _incremental_async_, _data_,  and _sync_.
  If set to
  _none_,
  no special effort is made to flush the audit records to disk. If set to
  _incremental_,
  Then the
  _freq_
  parameter is used to determine how often an explicit flush to disk is issued.
  The
  _incremental_async_
  parameter is very much like
  _incremental_
  except the flushing is done asynchronously for higher performance. The
  _data_
  parameter tells the audit daemon to keep the data portion of the disk file
  sync'd at all times. The
  _sync_
  option tells the audit daemon to keep both the data and meta-data fully
  sync'd with every write to disk. The default value is incremental_async.
* _freq_  
  This is a non-negative number that tells the audit daemon how many records to
  write before issuing an explicit flush to disk command. This value is only
  valid when the
  _flush_
  keyword is set to
  _incremental_
  or incremental_async.
* _num_logs_  
  This keyword specifies the number of log files to keep if rotate is given
  as the
  _max_log_file_action._
  If the number is &lt; 2, logs are not rotated. This number must be 999 or less.
  The default is 0 - which means no rotation. As you increase the number of log files being rotated, you may need to adjust the kernel backlog setting upwards since it takes more time to rotate the files. This is typically done in /etc/audit/audit.rules. If log rotation is configured to occur, the daemon will check for excess logs and remove them in effort to keep disk space available. The excess log check is only done on startup and when a reconfigure results in a space check.
* _name_format_  
  This option controls how computer node names are inserted into the audit event stream. It has the following choices:
  _none_, _hostname_, _fqd_, _numeric_, and _user_.
  _None_
  means that no computer name is inserted into the audit event.
  _hostname_
  is the name returned by the gethostname syscall. The
  _fqd_
  means that it takes the hostname and resolves it with dns for a fully qualified
  domain name of that machine.
  _Numeric_
  is similar to fqd except it resolves the IP address of the machine. In order to use this option, you might want to test that 'hostname -i' or 'domainname -i' returns a numeric address. Also, this option is not recommended if dhcp is used because you could have different addresses over time for the same machine.
  _User_
  is an admin defined string from the name option. The default value is
  _none_.
* _name_  
  This is the admin defined string that identifies the machine if
  _user_
  is given as the
  _name_format_
  option.
* _max_log_file_  
  This keyword specifies the maximum file size in megabytes. When this limit
  is reached, it will trigger a configurable action. The value given must be numeric.
* _max_log_file_action_  
  This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has
  detected that the max file size limit has been reached. Valid values are
  _ignore_, _syslog_, _suspend_, _rotate_ and _keep_logs._
  If set to
  _ignore_,
  the audit daemon does nothing.
  _syslog_
  means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
  _suspend_
  will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be alive. The
  _rotate_
  option will cause the audit daemon to rotate the logs. It should be noted that logs with higher numbers are older than logs with lower numbers. This is the same convention used by the logrotate utility. The
  _keep_logs_
  option is similar to rotate except it does not use the num_logs setting. This prevents audit logs from being overwritten. The effect is that logs accumulate and are not deleted - which will trigger the
  _space_left_action_
  if the volume fills up. This is best used in combination with an external script used to archive logs on a periodic basis.
* _verify_email_  
  This option determines if the email address given in
  _action_mail_acct_
  is checked to see if the domain name can be resolved. This option must be given before
  _action_mail_acct_
  or the default value of yes will be used.
* _action_mail_acct_  
  This option should contain a valid email address or alias. The default address is root. If the email address is not local to the machine, you must make sure you have email properly configured on your machine and network. Also, this option requires that /usr/lib/sendmail exists on the machine.
* _space_left_  
  If the free space in the filesystem containing
  _log_file_
  drops below this value, the audit daemon takes the action specified by
  _space_left_action_.
  If the value of
  _space_left_
  is specified as a whole number, it is interpreted as an absolute size in megabytes (MiB).  If the value is specified as a number between 1 and 99 followed by a percentage sign (e.g., 5%), the audit daemon calculates the absolute size in megabytes based on the size of the filesystem containing
  _log_file_.
  (E.g., if the filesystem containing
  _log_file_
  is 2 gigabytes in size, and
  _space_left_
  is set to 25%, then the audit daemon sets 
  _space_left_
  to approxiatemly 500 megabytes.  Note that this calculation is performed when the audit daemon starts, so if you resize the filesystem containing
  _log_file_
  while the audit daemon is running, you should send the audit daemon SIGHUP to re-read the configuration file and recalculate the correct percentage.
* _space_left_action_  
  This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has
  detected that it is starting to get low on disk space.
  Valid values are
  _ignore_, _syslog_, _rotate_, _email_, _exec_, _suspend_, _single_, and _halt_.
  If set to
  _ignore_,
  the audit daemon does nothing.
  _syslog_
  means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
  _rotate_
  will rotate logs, losing the oldest to free up space.
  _Email_
  means that it will send a warning to the email account specified in
  _action_mail_acct_
  as well as sending the message to syslog.
  _exec_
  /path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot pass parameters to the script. The script is also responsible for telling the auditd daemon to resume logging once its completed its action. This can be done by adding service auditd resume to the script.
  _suspend_
  will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be alive. The
  _single_
  option will cause the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode. The
  _halt_
  option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer system. Except for rotate, it will perform this action just one time.
* _admin_space_left_  
  This is a numeric value in megabytes that tells the audit daemon when
  to perform a configurable action because the system
  **is running low**
  on disk space. This should be considered the last chance to do something before running out of disk space. The numeric value for this parameter should be lower than the number for space_left. You may also append a percent sign (e.g. 1%) to the number to have the audit daemon calculate the number based on the disk partition size.
* _admin_space_left_action_  
  This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has
  detected that it
  **is low on disk space.**
  Valid values are
  _ignore_, _syslog_, _rotate_, _email_, _exec_, _suspend_, _single_, and _halt_.
  If set to
  _ignore_,
  the audit daemon does nothing.
  _Syslog_
  means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
  _rotate_
  will rotate logs, losing the oldest to free up space.
  _Email_
  means that it will send a warning to the email account specified in
  _action_mail_acct_
  as well as sending the message to syslog.
  _exec_
  /path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot pass parameters to the script. The script is also responsible for telling the auditd daemon to resume logging once its completed its action. This can be done by adding service auditd resume to the script.
  _Suspend_
  will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be alive. The
  _single_
  option will cause the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode. The
  _halt_
  option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer system. Except for r
  otate, it will perform this action just one time.
* _disk_full_action_  
  This parameter tells the system what action to take when the system has
  detected that the partition to which log files are written has become full. Valid values are
  _ignore_, _syslog_, _rotate_, _exec_, _suspend_, _single_, and _halt_.
  If set to
  _ignore_,
  the audit daemon will issue a syslog message but no other action is taken.
  _Syslog_
  means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
  _rotate_
  will rotate logs, losing the oldest to free up space.
  _exec_
  /path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot pass parameters to the script. The script is also responsible for telling the auditd daemon to resume logging
  g once its completed its action. This can be done by adding service auditd resume to the script.
  _Suspend_
  will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be alive. The
  _single_
  option will cause the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode.
  _halt_
  option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer system.
* _disk_error_action_  
  This parameter tells the system what action to take whenever there is an error
  detected when writing audit events to disk or rotating logs. Valid values are
  _ignore_, _syslog_, _exec_, _suspend_, _single_, and _halt_.
  If set to
  _ignore_,
  the audit daemon will not take any action.
  _Syslog_
  means that it will issue no more than 5 consecutive warnings to syslog.
  _exec_
  /path-to-script will execute the script. You cannot pass parameters to the script.
  _Suspend_
  will cause the audit daemon to stop writing records to the disk. The daemon will still be alive. The
  _single_
  option will cause the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode.
  _halt_
  option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer system.
* _tcp_listen_port_  
  This is a numeric value in the range 1..65535 which, if specified,
  causes auditd to listen on the corresponding TCP port for audit
  records from remote systems. The audit daemon may be linked with
  tcp_wrappers. You may want to control access with an entry in the
  hosts.allow and deny files. If this is deployed on a systemd based
  OS, then you may need to adjust the 'After' directive. See the note in
  the auditd.service file.
* _tcp_listen_queue_  
  This is a numeric value which indicates how many pending (requested
  but unaccepted) connections are allowed.  The default is 5.  Setting
  this too small may cause connections to be rejected if too many hosts
  start up at exactly the same time, such as after a power failure. This
  setting is only used for aggregating servers. Clients logging to a remote
  server should keep this commented out.
* _tcp_max_per_addr_  
  This is a numeric value which indicates how many concurrent connections from
  one IP address is allowed.  The default is 1 and the maximum is 1024. Setting
  this too large may allow for a Denial of Service attack on the logging
  server. Also note that the kernel has an internal maximum that will eventually
  prevent this even if auditd allows it by config. The default should be adequate
  in most cases unless a custom written recovery script runs to forward unsent
  events. In this case you would increase the number only large enough to let it
  in too.
* _use_libwrap_  
  This setting determines whether or not to use tcp_wrappers to discern connection attempts that are from allowed machines. Legal values are either 
  _yes_, or _no_
  The default value is yes.
* _tcp_client_ports_  
  This parameter may be a single numeric value or two values separated
  by a dash (no spaces allowed).  It indicates which client ports are
  allowed for incoming connections.  If not specified, any port is
  allowed.  Allowed values are 1..65535.  For example, to require the
  client use a priviledged port, specify
  _1-1023_
  for this parameter. You will also need to set the local_port option in the audisp-remote.conf file. Making sure that clients send from a privileged port is a security feature to prevent log injection attacks by untrusted users.
* _tcp_client_max_idle_  
  This parameter indicates the number of seconds that a client may be idle (i.e. no data from them at all) before auditd complains. This is used to close inactive connections if the client machine has a problem where it cannot shutdown the connection cleanly. Note that this is a global setting, and must be higher than any individual client heartbeat_timeout setting, preferably by a factor of two.  The default is zero, which disables this check.
* _transport_  
  If set to
  _TCP_,
  only clear text tcp connections will be used. If set to
  _KRB5_,
  then Kerberos 5 will be used for authentication and encryption. The default value is TCP.
* _enable_krb5_  
  This option is deprecated. Use the
  _transport_
  option above instead. If set to "yes", Kerberos 5 will be used for
  authentication and encryption.  The default is "no". If this option is set
  to "yes" and it follows the transport option, it will override the transport
  setting. This would be the normal expected behavior for backwards compatibility.
* _krb5_principal_  
  This is the principal for this server.  The default is "auditd".
  Given this default, the server will look for a key named like
  _auditd/hostname@EXAMPLE.COM_
  stored in
  _/etc/audit/audit.key_
  to authenticate itself, where hostname is the canonical name for the
  server's host, as returned by a DNS lookup of its IP address.
* _krb5_key_file_  
  Location of the key for this client's principal.
  Note that the key file must be owned by root and mode 0400.
  The default is
  _/etc/audit/audit.key_
* _distribute_network_  
  If set to "yes", network originating events will be distributed to the audit
  dispatcher for processing. The default is "no".
* _q_depth_  
  This is a numeric value that tells how big to make the internal queue of the audit event dispatcher. A bigger queue lets it handle a flood of events better, but could hold events that are not processed when the daemon is terminated. If you get messages in syslog about events getting dropped, increase this value. The default value is 400.
* _overflow_action_  
  This option determines how the daemon should react to overflowing its internal queue. When this happens, it means that more events are being received than it can pass along to child processes. This error means that it is going to lose the current event that it's trying to dispatch. This option has the following choices:
  _ignore_, _syslog_, _suspend_, _single_, and _halt_.
  If set to
  _ignore_,
  the audit daemon does nothing.
  _syslog_
  means that it will issue a warning to syslog.
  _suspend_
  will cause the audit daemon to stop sending events to child processes. The daemon will still be alive. The
  _single_
  option will cause the audit daemon to put the computer system in single user mode.
  _halt_
  option will cause the audit daemon to shutdown the computer system.
* _max_restarts_  
  This is a non-negative number that tells the audit event dispatcher how many times it can try to restart a crashed plugin. The default is 10.
* _plugin_dir_  
  This is the location that auditd will use to search for its plugin configuration files.

# Notes

In a CAPP environment, the audit trail is considered so important that access to system resources must be denied if an audit trail cannot be created. In this environment, it would be suggested that /var/log/audit be on its own partition. This is to ensure that space detection is accurate and that no other process comes along and consumes part of it.

The flush parameter should be set to sync or data.

Max_log_file and num_logs need to be adjusted so that you get complete use of your partition. It should be noted that the more files that have to be rotated, the longer it takes to get back to receiving audit events. Max_log_file_action should be set to keep_logs.

Space_left should be set to a number that gives the admin enough time to react to any alert message and perform some maintenance to free up disk space. This would typically involve running the **aureport -t** report and moving the oldest logs to an archive area. The value of space_left is site dependent since the rate at which events are generated varies with each deployment. The space_left_action is recommended to be set to email. If you need something like an snmp trap, you can use the exec option to send one.

Admin_space_left should be set to the amount of disk space on the audit partition needed for admin actions to be recorded. Admin_space_left_action would be set to single so that use of the machine is restricted to just the console.

The disk_full_action is triggered when no more room exists on the partition. All access should be terminated since no more audit capability exists. This can be set to either single or halt.

The disk_error_action should be set to syslog, single, or halt depending on your local policies regarding handling of hardware malfunctions.

Specifying a single allowed client port may make it difficult for the
client to restart their audit subsystem, as it will be unable to
recreate a connection with the same host addresses and ports until the
connection closure TIME_WAIT state times out.
