# Description

**socket**()
creates an endpoint for communication and returns a file descriptor
that refers to that endpoint.
The file descriptor returned by a successful call will be
the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process.

The
_domain_
argument specifies a communication domain; this selects the protocol
family which will be used for communication.
These families are defined in
_&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;_.
The currently understood formats include:

The socket has the indicated
_type_,
which specifies the communication semantics.
Currently defined types
are:

* **SOCK_STREAM**  
  Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams.
  An out-of-band data transmission mechanism may be supported.
* **SOCK_DGRAM**  
  Supports datagrams (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed
  maximum length).
* **SOCK_SEQPACKET**  
  Provides a sequenced, reliable, two-way connection-based data
  transmission path for datagrams of fixed maximum length; a consumer is
  required to read an entire packet with each input system call.
* **SOCK_RAW**  
  Provides raw network protocol access.
* **SOCK_RDM**  
  Provides a reliable datagram layer that does not guarantee ordering.
* **SOCK_PACKET**  
  Obsolete and should not be used in new programs;
  see
  **packet**(7).

Some socket types may not be implemented by all protocol families.

Since Linux 2.6.27, the
_type_
argument serves a second purpose:
in addition to specifying a socket type,
it may include the bitwise OR of any of the following values,
to modify the behavior of
**socket**():

* **SOCK_NONBLOCK**  
  Set the
  **O_NONBLOCK**
  file status flag on the new open file description.
  Using this flag saves extra calls to
  **fcntl**(2)
  to achieve the same result.
* **SOCK_CLOEXEC**  
  Set the close-on-exec
  (**FD_CLOEXEC**)
  flag on the new file descriptor.
  See the description of the
  **O_CLOEXEC**
  flag in
  **open**(2)
  for reasons why this may be useful.

The
_protocol_
specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket.
Normally only a single protocol exists to support a particular
socket type within a given protocol family, in which case
_protocol_
can be specified as 0.
However, it is possible that many protocols may exist, in
which case a particular protocol must be specified in this manner.
The protocol number to use is specific to the communication domain\*(rq
in which communication is to take place; see
**protocols**(5).
See
**getprotoent**(3)
on how to map protocol name strings to protocol numbers.

Sockets of type
**SOCK_STREAM**
are full-duplex byte streams.
They do not preserve
record boundaries.
A stream socket must be in
a
_connected_
state before any data may be sent or received on it.
A connection to
another socket is created with a
**connect**(2)
call.
Once connected, data may be transferred using
**read**(2)
and
**write**(2)
calls or some variant of the
**send**(2)
and
**recv**(2)
calls.
When a session has been completed a
**close**(2)
may be performed.
Out-of-band data may also be transmitted as described in
**send**(2)
and received as described in
**recv**(2).

The communications protocols which implement a
**SOCK_STREAM**
ensure that data is not lost or duplicated.
If a piece of data for which
the peer protocol has buffer space cannot be successfully transmitted
within a reasonable length of time, then the connection is considered
to be dead.
When
**SO_KEEPALIVE**
is enabled on the socket the protocol checks in a protocol-specific
manner if the other end is still alive.
A
**SIGPIPE**
signal is raised if a process sends or receives
on a broken stream; this causes naive processes,
which do not handle the signal, to exit.
**SOCK_SEQPACKET**
sockets employ the same system calls as
**SOCK_STREAM**
sockets.
The only difference is that
**read**(2)
calls will return only the amount of data requested,
and any data remaining in the arriving packet will be discarded.
Also all message boundaries in incoming datagrams are preserved.

**SOCK_DGRAM**
and
**SOCK_RAW**
sockets allow sending of datagrams to correspondents named in
**sendto**(2)
calls.
Datagrams are generally received with
**recvfrom**(2),
which returns the next datagram along with the address of its sender.

**SOCK_PACKET**
is an obsolete socket type to receive raw packets directly from the
device driver.
Use
**packet**(7)
instead.

An
**fcntl**(2)
**F_SETOWN**
operation can be used to specify a process or process group to receive a
**SIGURG**
signal when the out-of-band data arrives or
**SIGPIPE**
signal when a
**SOCK_STREAM**
connection breaks unexpectedly.
This operation may also be used to set the process or process group
that receives the I/O and asynchronous notification of I/O events via
**SIGIO**.
Using
**F_SETOWN**
is equivalent to an
**ioctl**(2)
call with the
**FIOSETOWN**
or
**SIOCSPGRP**
argument.

When the network signals an error condition to the protocol module (e.g.,
using an ICMP message for IP) the pending error flag is set for the socket.
The next operation on this socket will return the error code of the pending
error.
For some protocols it is possible to enable a per-socket error queue
to retrieve detailed information about the error; see
**IP_RECVERR**
in
**ip**(7).

The operation of sockets is controlled by socket level
_options_.
These options are defined in
_&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;_.
The functions
**setsockopt**(2)
and
**getsockopt**(2)
are used to set and get options, respectively.

# Return Value

On success, a file descriptor for the new socket is returned.
On error, -1 is returned, and
_errno_
is set appropriately.

<a name="errors"></a>

# Errors


* **EACCES**  
  Permission to create a socket of the specified type and/or protocol
  is denied.
* **EAFNOSUPPORT**  
  The implementation does not support the specified address family.
* **EINVAL**  
  Unknown protocol, or protocol family not available.
* **EINVAL**  
  
  Invalid flags in
  _type_.
* **EMFILE**  
  The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.
* **ENFILE**  
  The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
* **ENOBUFS** or **ENOMEM**  
  Insufficient memory is available.
  The socket cannot be
  created until sufficient resources are freed.
* **EPROTONOSUPPORT**  
  The protocol type or the specified protocol is not
  supported within this domain.

Other errors may be generated by the underlying protocol modules.

# Conforming to

POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD.

The
**SOCK_NONBLOCK**
and
**SOCK_CLOEXEC**
flags are Linux-specific.

**socket**()
appeared in 4.2BSD.
It is generally portable to/from
non-BSD systems supporting clones of the BSD socket layer (including
System&nbsp;V variants).

<a name="notes"></a>

# Notes

POSIX.1 does not require the inclusion of
_&lt;sys/types.h&gt;_,
and this header file is not required on Linux.
However, some historical (BSD) implementations required this header
file, and portable applications are probably wise to include it.

The manifest constants used under 4.x BSD for protocol families
are
**PF_UNIX**,
**PF_INET**,
and so on, while
**AF_UNIX**,
**AF_INET**,
and so on are used for address
families.
However, already the BSD man page promises: "The protocol
family generally is the same as the address family", and subsequent
standards use AF_* everywhere.

The
**AF_ALG**
protocol type was added in Linux 2.6.38.
More information on this interface is provided with the kernel HTML
documentation at
_https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/crypto-API/User.html_.
