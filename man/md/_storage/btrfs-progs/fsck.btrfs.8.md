# Description


**fsck.btrfs** is a type of utility that should exist for any filesystem and is called during system setup when the corresponding **/etc/fstab** entries contain non-zero value for **fs\_passno**, see **fstab**(5) for more.

Traditional filesystems need to run their respective fsck utility in case the filesystem was not unmounted cleanly and the log needs to be replayed before mount. This is not needed for BTRFS. You should set fs_passno to 0.

If you wish to check the consistency of a BTRFS filesystem or repair a damaged filesystem, see **btrfs-check**(8). By default filesystem consistency is checked, the repair mode is enabled via the _--repair_ option (use with care!).
