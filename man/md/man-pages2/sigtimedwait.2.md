# Description

**sigwaitinfo**()
suspends execution of the calling thread until one of the signals in
_set_
is pending
(If one of the signals in
_set_
is already pending for the calling thread,
**sigwaitinfo**()
will return immediately.)

**sigwaitinfo**()
removes the signal from the set of pending
signals and returns the signal number as its function result.
If the
_info_
argument is not NULL,
then the buffer that it points to is used to return a structure of type
_siginfo_t_
(see
**sigaction**(2))
containing information about the signal.

If multiple signals in
_set_
are pending for the caller, the signal that is retrieved by
**sigwaitinfo**()
is determined according to the usual ordering rules; see
**signal**(7)
for further details.

**sigtimedwait**()
operates in exactly the same way as
**sigwaitinfo**()
except that it has an additional argument,
_timeout_,
which specifies the interval for which
the thread is suspended waiting for a signal.
(This interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
and kernel scheduling delays mean that the interval
may overrun by a small amount.)
This argument is of the following type:

.in +4n
.EX
struct timespec {
    long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
    long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
}
.EE
.in

If both fields of this structure are specified as 0, a poll is performed:
**sigtimedwait**()
returns immediately, either with information about a signal that
was pending for the caller, or with an error
if none of the signals in
_set_
was pending.

# Return Value

On success, both
**sigwaitinfo**()
and
**sigtimedwait**()
return a signal number (i.e., a value greater than zero).
On failure both calls return -1, with
_errno_
set to indicate the error.

<a name="errors"></a>

# Errors


* **EAGAIN**  
  No signal in
  _set_
  was became pending within the
  _timeout_
  period specified to
  **sigtimedwait**().
* **EINTR**  
  The wait was interrupted by a signal handler; see
  **signal**(7).
  (This handler was for a signal other than one of those in
  _set_.)
* **EINVAL**  
  _timeout_
  was invalid.

# Notes

In normal usage, the calling program blocks the signals in
_set_
via a prior call to
**sigprocmask**(2)
(so that the default disposition for these signals does not occur if they
become pending between successive calls to
**sigwaitinfo**()
or
**sigtimedwait**())
and does not establish handlers for these signals.
In a multithreaded program,
the signal should be blocked in all threads, in order to prevent
the signal being treated according to its default disposition in
a thread other than the one calling
**sigwaitinfo**()
or
**sigtimedwait**()).

The set of signals that is pending for a given thread is the
union of the set of signals that is pending specifically for that thread
and the set of signals that is pending for the process as a whole (see
**signal**(7)).

Attempts to wait for
**SIGKILL**
and
**SIGSTOP**
are silently ignored.

If multiple threads of a process are blocked
waiting for the same signal(s) in
**sigwaitinfo**()
or
**sigtimedwait**(),
then exactly one of the threads will actually receive the
signal if it becomes pending for the process as a whole;
which of the threads receives the signal is indeterminate.

**sigwaitinfo**()
or
**sigtimedwait**(),
can't be used to receive signals that
are synchronously generated, such as the
**SIGSEGV**
signal that results from accessing an invalid memory address
or the
**SIGFPE**
signal that results from an arithmetic error.
Such signals can be caught only via signal handler.

POSIX leaves the meaning of a NULL value for the
_timeout_
argument of
**sigtimedwait**()
unspecified, permitting the possibility that this has the same meaning
as a call to
**sigwaitinfo**(),
and indeed this is what is done on Linux.

### C library/kernel differences

On Linux,
**sigwaitinfo**()
is a library function implemented on top of
**sigtimedwait**().

The glibc wrapper functions for
**sigwaitinfo**()
and
**sigtimedwait**()
silently ignore attempts to wait for the two real-time signals that
are used internally by the NPTL threading implementation.
See
**nptl**(7)
for details.

The original Linux system call was named
**sigtimedwait**().
However, with the addition of real-time signals in Linux 2.2,
the fixed-size, 32-bit
_sigset_t_
type supported by that system call was no longer fit for purpose.
Consequently, a new system call,
**rt_sigtimedwait**(),
was added to support an enlarged
_sigset_t_
type.
The new system call takes a fourth argument,
_size_t sigsetsize_,
which specifies the size in bytes of the signal set in
_set_.
This argument is currently required to have the value
_sizeof(sigset_t)_
(or the error
**EINVAL**
results).
The glibc
**sigtimedwait**()
wrapper function hides these details from us, transparently calling
**rt_sigtimedwait**()
when the kernel provides it.
