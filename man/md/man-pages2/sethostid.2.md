# Description

**gethostid**()
and
**sethostid**()
respectively get or set a unique 32-bit identifier for the current machine.
The 32-bit identifier is intended to be unique among all UNIX systems in
existence.
This normally resembles the Internet address for the local
machine, as returned by
**gethostbyname**(3),
and thus usually never needs to be set.

The
**sethostid**()
call is restricted to the superuser.

<a name="return-value"></a>

# Return Value

**gethostid**()
returns the 32-bit identifier for the current host as set by
**sethostid**().

On success,
**sethostid**()
returns 0; on error, -1 is returned, and
_errno_
is set to indicate the error.

<a name="errors"></a>

# Errors

**sethostid**()
can fail with the following errors:

* **EACCES**  
  The caller did not have permission to write to the file used
  to store the host ID.
* **EPERM**  
  The calling process's effective user or group ID is not the same
  as its corresponding real ID.

# Conforming to

4.2BSD; these functions were dropped in 4.4BSD.
SVr4 includes
**gethostid**()
but not
**sethostid**().

POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 specify
**gethostid**()
but not
**sethostid**().

# Notes

In the glibc implementation, the
_hostid_
is stored in the file
_/etc/hostid_.
(In glibc versions before 2.2, the file
_/var/adm/hostid_
was used.)


In the glibc implementation, if
**gethostid**()
cannot open the file containing the host ID,
then it obtains the hostname using
**gethostname**(2),
passes that hostname to
**gethostbyname_r**(3)
in order to obtain the host's IPv4 address,
and returns a value obtained by bit-twiddling the IPv4 address.
(This value may not be unique.)

# Bugs

It is impossible to ensure that the identifier is globally unique.
