# Description


The command
**ALTER PUBLICATION**
can change the attributes of a publication.

The first three variants change which tables are part of the publication. The
SET TABLE
clause will replace the list of tables in the publication with the specified one. The
ADD TABLE
and
DROP TABLE
clauses will add and remove one or more tables from the publication. Note that adding tables to a publication that is already subscribed to will require a
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION
action on the subscribing side in order to become effective.

The fourth variant of this command listed in the synopsis can change all of the publication properties specified in
CREATE PUBLICATION (**CREATE\_PUBLICATION**(7)). Properties not mentioned in the command retain their previous settings.

The remaining variants change the owner and the name of the publication.

You must own the publication to use
**ALTER PUBLICATION**. Adding a table to a publication additionally requires owning that table. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role. The new owner must have
CREATE
privilege on the database. Also, the new owner of a
FOR ALL TABLES
publication must be a superuser. However, a superuser can change the ownership of a publication regardless of these restrictions.

# Parameters


_name_

ONLY
is specified before the table name, only that table is affected. If

*
can be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included.

SET ( _publication\_parameter_ [= _value_] [, ... ] )
This clause alters publication parameters originally set by
CREATE PUBLICATION (**CREATE\_PUBLICATION**(7)). See there for more information.

_new\_owner_
The user name of the new owner of the publication.
