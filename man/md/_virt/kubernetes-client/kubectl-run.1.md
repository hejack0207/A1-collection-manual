 kubectl run [OPTIONS]
```



<a name="description"></a>

# Description


Create and run a particular image, possibly replicated.


Creates a deployment or job to manage the created container(s).



<a name="options"></a>

# Options


**--allow-missing-template-keys**=true
    If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.


**--attach**=false
    If true, wait for the Pod to start running, and then attach to the Pod as if 'kubectl attach ...' were called.  Default false, unless '-i/--stdin' is set, in which case the default is true. With '--restart=Never' the exit code of the container process is returned.


**--cascade**=true
    If true, cascade the deletion of the resources managed by this resource (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController).  Default true.


**--command**=false
    If true and extra arguments are present, use them as the 'command' field in the container, rather than the 'args' field which is the default.


**--dry-run**=false
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.


**--env**=[]
    Environment variables to set in the container


**--expose**=false
    If true, a public, external service is created for the container(s) which are run


**-f**, **--filename**=[]
    to use to replace the resource.


**--force**=false
    Only used when grace-period=0. If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.


**--generator**=""
    The name of the API generator to use, see 
\[la]http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-conventions/#generators\[ra] for a list.


**--grace-period**=-1
    Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion).


**--hostport**=-1
    The host port mapping for the container port. To demonstrate a single-machine container.


**--image**=""
    The image for the container to run.


**--image-pull-policy**=""
    The image pull policy for the container. If left empty, this value will not be specified by the client and defaulted by the server


**-k**, **--kustomize**=""
    Process a kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.


**-l**, **--labels**=""
    Comma separated labels to apply to the pod(s). Will override previous values.


**--leave-stdin-open**=false
    If the pod is started in interactive mode or with stdin, leave stdin open after the first attach completes. By default, stdin will be closed after the first attach completes.


**--limits**=""
    The resource requirement limits for this container.  For example, 'cpu=200m,memory=512Mi'.  Note that server side components may assign limits depending on the server configuration, such as limit ranges.


**-o**, **--output**=""
    Output format. One of: json|yaml|name|go-template|go-template-file|template|templatefile|jsonpath|jsonpath-file.


**--overrides**=""
    An inline JSON override for the generated object. If this is non-empty, it is used to override the generated object. Requires that the object supply a valid apiVersion field.


**--pod-running-timeout**=1m0s
    The length of time (like 5s, 2m, or 3h, higher than zero) to wait until at least one pod is running


**--port**=""
    The port that this container exposes.  If --expose is true, this is also the port used by the service that is created.


**--quiet**=false
    If true, suppress prompt messages.


**--record**=false
    Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.


**-R**, **--recursive**=false
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.


**-r**, **--replicas**=1
    Number of replicas to create for this container. Default is 1.


**--requests**=""
    The resource requirement requests for this container.  For example, 'cpu=100m,memory=256Mi'.  Note that server side components may assign requests depending on the server configuration, such as limit ranges.


**--restart**="Always"
    The restart policy for this Pod.  Legal values [Always, OnFailure, Never].  If set to 'Always' a deployment is created, if set to 'OnFailure' a job is created, if set to 'Never', a regular pod is created. For the latter two --replicas must be 1.  Default 'Always', for CronJobs **\fCNever**.


**--rm**=false
    If true, delete resources created in this command for attached containers.


**--save-config**=false
    If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.


**--schedule**=""
    A schedule in the Cron format the job should be run with.


**--service-generator**="service/v2"
    The name of the generator to use for creating a service.  Only used if --expose is true


**--service-overrides**=""

**--serviceaccount**=""
    Service account to set in the pod spec


**-i**, **--stdin**=false
    Keep stdin open on the container(s) in the pod, even if nothing is attached.


**--template**=""
    Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [
\[la]http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview\[ra]].


**--timeout**=0s
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object


**-t**, **--tty**=false
    Allocated a TTY for each container in the pod.


**--wait**=false
    If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers.
