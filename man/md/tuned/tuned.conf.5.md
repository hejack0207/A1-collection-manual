# tuned.conf(5) - TuneD profile definition

Jan Kaluža, 13 Mar 2012


<a name="description"></a>

# Description

This man page documents format of TuneD 2.0 profile definition files.
The profile definition is stored in /etc/tuned/&lt;profile_name&gt;/tuned.conf or in
/usr/lib/tuned/&lt;profile_name&gt;/tuned.conf file where the /etc/tuned/ directory has 
higher priority.

The **tuned.conf** configures the profile and it is in ini-file format.


<a name="main-section"></a>

# Main Section

The main section is called "[main]" and can contain following options:


* include=  
  Includes a profile with the given name. This allows you to base a new profile
  on an already existing profile. In case there are conflicting parameters in the
  new profile and the base profile, the parameters from the new profile are used.
  

<a name="plugins"></a>

# Plugins

Every other section defines one plugin. The name of the section is used as name
for the plugin and is used in logs to identify the plugin. There can be only
one plugin of particular type tuning particular device. Conflicts are by
default fixed by merging the options of both plugins together. This can be
changed by "replace" option.

Every plugin section can contain following sections:


* type=  
  Plugin type. Currently there are following upstream plugins: audio, bootloader, cpu, disk,
  eeepc_she, modules, mounts, net, script, scsi_host, selinux, scheduler, sysctl,
  sysfs, systemd, usb, video, vm. This list may be incomplete. If you installed
  TuneD through RPM you can list upstream plugins by the following command:
  **rpm -ql tuned | grep 'plugins/plugin_.*.py$'**
  Check the plugins directory returned by this command to see all plugins (e.g. plugins
  provided by 3rd party packages).
  
* devices=  
  Comma separated list of devices which should be tuned by this plugin instance.
  If you omit this option, all found devices will be tuned.
* replace=1  
  If there is conflict between two plugins (meaning two plugins of the same
  type are trying to configure the same devices), then the plugin defined as
  last replaces all options defined by the previously defined plugin.

Plugins can also have plugin related options.


<a name="example"></a>

# Example

    [main]
    # Includes plugins defined in "included" profile.
    include=included
    
    # Define my_sysctl plugin
    [my_sysctl]
    type=sysctl
    # This plugin will replace any sysctl plugin defined in "included" profile
    replace=1
    # 256 KB default performs well experimentally.
    net.core.rmem_default = 262144
    net.core.wmem_default = 262144
    
    # Define my_script plugin
    # Both scripts (profile.sh from this profile and script from "included"
    # profile) will be run, because if there is no "replace=1" option the
    # default action is merge.
    [my_script]
    type=script
    script=${i:PROFILE_DIR}/profile.sh
