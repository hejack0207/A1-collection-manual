# Description


systemd-machine-id-commit.service
is an early boot service responsible for committing transient
/etc/machine-id
files to a writable disk file system. See
**machine-id**(5)
for more information about machine IDs.

This service is started after
local-fs.target
in case
/etc/machine-id
is a mount point of its own (usually from a memory file system such as
"tmpfs") and /etc is writable. The service will invoke
**systemd-machine-id-setup --commit**, which writes the current transient machine ID to disk and unmount the
/etc/machine-id
file in a race-free manner to ensure that file is always valid and accessible for other processes. See
**systemd-machine-id-setup**(1)
for details.

The main use case of this service are systems where
/etc/machine-id
is read-only and initially not initialized. In this case, the system manager will generate a transient machine ID file on a memory file system, and mount it over
/etc/machine-id, during the early boot phase. This service is then invoked in a later boot phase, as soon as
/etc
has been remounted writable and the ID may thus be committed to disk to make it permanent.
